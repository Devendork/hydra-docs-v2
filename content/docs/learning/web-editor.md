## Get to know the browser editor
To get started, open the the [hydra web editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) in a separate window.   Close the top window by clicking the [x] in the top right.

You will see some colorful visuals in the background with text on top in the top left of the screen. The text is code that generates the visuals behind it. 

At the right up corner you will find a toolbar with these buttons:

1. **run all code** Runs all code on the page (same as typing *ctrl+shift+enter)
2. **upload to gallery** upload a sketch to Hydra's gallery and create a shorter URL
3. **clear all** resets the environment and clears text from the editor
4. **show random sketch**. Loads random sketch examples. Always it is a good way to learn Hydra by studying someone elses code.
5. **make random change** **dices** modify values automatically. Try it with some of the sketch examples.
6. **show info window** show overlay window with help text and links


## Save your sketch on the internet


When you evaluate the entire code with the ***run button*** or with `shift + ctrl + enter`, Hydra automatically generates a URL that contains the last changes of your sketch. You can copy and paste the url from the URL bar to save it or share it with other people. You can also use the browser `back` and `forward` arrows to navigate to earlier versions of your sketch.
