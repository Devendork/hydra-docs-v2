## [web editor](web-editor)
key commands, comments, saving sketches, loading extensions and external libraries, publishing to the gallery

## [video synth basics](video-synth-basics) 
overview of hydra's [modular approach](video-synth-basics) and main function types: [sources](video-synth-basics/src), [geometry](video-synth-basics/coord), [color](video-synth-basics/color), [blending](video-synth-basics/combine), and [modulation](video-synth-basics/combinecoord). 
## [external sources](video-synth-basics/external-sources/)

how to change the [speed](), [bpm](), and [resolution]() of a hydra instance, as well as write custom glsl functions -->


## [extending hydra](extending-hydra/extending-hydra)
using hydra with other javascript libraries such as P5.js, Tone.js, strudel. Writing [custom GLSL functions](extending-hydra/glsl), and [using hydra in your own webpage](extending-hydra/hydra-in-a-webpage).
