# Getting started

## Play with gallery examples
The simplest way to get started with hydra is to play around with the example sketches in the [web editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/).

To get started, open the the [hydra web editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) in a separate window.   Close the top window by clicking the [x] in the top right.

You will see some colorful visuals in the background with text on top. The text is code that generates the visuals behind it. 

You can change the hydra sketch shown on the screen by clicking the shuffle button. 

## Change some numbers
Change values that appears on Hydra web editor at the sketch examples to see what happens.
Values can have decimal numbers, is recommended not using big values inside the parentheses. Numbers must be **inside** the parentheses.
Every Hydra code starts by generating an input signal source and ends with an output buffer. Adding a value inside or after `.out()` **won't** work.


```javascript
osc(10,0.1,0.5).color(1,0.895,0.55).out()
```

## Run your code
Use the triangle "run" button to run your code. 
Hint: you can also run the code by typing `ctrl+shift+enter`.

## Have fun!
:)
