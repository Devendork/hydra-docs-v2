# How can I livecode Hydra without showing the code over the visuals?


You can either:

## Use Flok:

Enter the session in both tabs. You can disable Hydra on one of them if you want to (this would also lower resource demand).
On one of your tabs, press "Ctrl+Shift+H" to hide the code.
Now you can code on one tab and commands will also run on the other tab!

## Use your browser's dev tools console:
