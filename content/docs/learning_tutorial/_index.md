## learning
### Getting started
* **[video synth basics](video-synth-basics)**:
overview of hydra's [modular approach](video-synth-basics) and main function types: sources, geometry, color, blending, and modulation. 
* **[external sources](getting-started/external-sources.md):** using [webcams](basic hydra functions/external-sources.md#using-the-webcam), [images](/external-sources/#initimage), [videos](external-sources/#initvideo), [html canvas elements](external-sources/#init), and [live streams](external-sources/#initstream) inside a hydra sketch
### Next steps
* **[sequencing and interactivity](interactivity):** 
Making dynamic and interactive sketches using [arrays](interactivity/#sequencing-using-arrays), [custom functions](interactivity/#custom-functions), [audio reactivity](interactivity/#audio-reactivity), [mouse input](interactivity/#mouse-interactivity), and [MIDI controllers](interactivity/#midi).
<!-- ### [synth configuration]()
how to change the [speed](), [bpm](), and [resolution]() of a hydra instance, as well as write custom glsl functions -->
* **[extending hydra](extending-hydra)**
using hydra with other javascript libraries such as P5.js, Tone.js, strudel. Loading libraries and extensions. 
## More Resources 

* **[how-to](how-to):**
a quick reference for common questions
* **[guides](guides)**
deeper dives into hydra topics written by members of the community.

## Api reference
### [web editor](video-synth-basics/web-editor)
