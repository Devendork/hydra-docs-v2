# Getting started with hydra

This document is an introduction to making live visuals using Hydra. It covers the basics of writing code in the browser to generate and mix live video sources. No coding or video experience is necessary! 

If you just want to start in 60 seconds you can also check:

This tutorial is meant to be used from within the [hydra web editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/). It is also interactive -- you can directly modify the code in each code block to see how it affects the visuals.  

## Get to know the browser editor
To get started, open the the [hydra web editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) in a separate window.   Close the top window by clicking the [x] in the top right.

You will see some colorful visuals in the background with text on top in the top left of the screen. The text is code that generates the visuals behind it. 

At the right up corner you will find a toolbar with these buttons:

1. **run all code** Runs all code on the page (same as typing *ctrl+shift+enter)
2. **upload to gallery** upload a sketch to Hydra's gallery and create a shorter URL
3. **clear all** resets the environment and clears text from the editor
4. **show random sketch**. Loads random sketch examples. Always it is a good way to learn Hydra by studying someone elses code.
5. **make random change** **dices** modify values automatically. Try it with some of the sketch examples.
6. **show info window** show overlay window with help text and links
